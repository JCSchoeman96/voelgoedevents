# Ash Validations

**AGENTS: READ BEFORE CREATING FILES**

This folder contains **reusable** Ash validations.
- **Naming:** `VoelgoedEvents.Ash.Validations.[Name]`
- **Scope:** Generic validations only (e.g., `DateIsFuture`, `EmailFormat`).
- **Domain Specific?** If a validation is very specific to a domain (e.g., `TicketPricing`), put it in the Domain resource, not here.
