# Dialyzer ignore-warnings file
#
# Phases 1–9: use this list to document genuinely non-blocking false positives
# surfaced during CI (report-only). Each entry must include a justification.
# Remove or resolve entries when Phase 10 re-enables strict exits.
#
# Format: one warning pattern per line, e.g.:
# lib/voelgoedevents/example.ex:42: Unknown function call (false positive: generated at runtime)
