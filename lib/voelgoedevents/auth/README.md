# Authentication & Authorization Layer

**Purpose:** Modules for handling application-level authentication flows (login, registration, password reset) and token management (e.g., JWT, API Keys).
**Boundary:** Provides plugs for high-level authorization (checking if a user is logged in) and token generation/validation (separate from Ash's resource-level policies).
